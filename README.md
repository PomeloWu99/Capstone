## Part I. Profit Margin Validation

Our first goal is to validate their current profit margin. The idea is to find the profit margin for each product class and compare it with target margin.

1. Methodology

For each transaction row, we calculate the profit margin based on (price-cost)/price since the quantity will be removed from our formula. Then we took the median of each product class in different years.
