## Data Cleaning



## Part I. Profit Margin Validation

Our first goal is to validate their current profit margin. The idea is to find the profit margin for each product class and compare it with target margin.

1. Methodology

For each transaction row, we calculate the profit margin based on (price-cost)/price since the quantity will be removed from our formula. Then we took the median of each product class in different years.

• A brief background section discussing the methods that people have used
to solve this or similar problems (with a small literature review)
• Technical details of the data set you are working with and the methods
you are using. When relevant, link to code or notebooks
• A presentation of your major results along with (i) an interpretation of
these results and (ii) and explanation of why these results tie into your
motivation/goal.
